# Alien vs. Zombie

From the guidelines: \
``Alien vs Zombie is a turn-based combat game in which the player controls Alien to defeat a group of
Zombies. Prior to the game, the player can customize settings including game board dimensions and
number of zombies. The player can also save a game into a file and load a game from a file.``

In this project, we tried to create the game in text version, and by using the C++ language. Here are some screenshots of how the program that has been created by our group looks like:
